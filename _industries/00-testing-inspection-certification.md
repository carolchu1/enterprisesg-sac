The Testing, Inspection and Certification (TIC) sector ensures the safety, integrity and quality of goods and services across different end industries through conformity assessment and assurance. The key roles of TIC are to provide conformity assessment for operational efficacy, catalyse R&D and innovation in emerging areas through verification and validation, establish mutual recognition to facilitate market access and provide quality assurance and trust of Singaporeâ€™s products and services. It is a key component in the national Standards & Conformance infrastructure supporting across industries and enterprise value chains.
 
 
<Update on Gradual Resumption of Business Activities from 2 Jun 2020>

The Circuit Breaker Measures will be gradually eased from 2 Jun 2020, and businesses will be allowed to resume activities in a phased manner. In Phase 1, besides the businesses that have been operating as at 1 June 2020, businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks may resume activities.

The TIC Sector has been permitted to operate during the Circuit Breaker and can continue to do so from 2 Jun 2020. There is no need to apply for resumption to operate. All businesses in operation from 2 Jun 2020 will need to submit their manpower details via the GoBusiness portal (https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg) and comply with Safe Management Measures (SMM). Sector specific requirements such as marine & offshore and construction sectors will be managed by EDB and BCA respectively.
 
Businesses can refer to the MOM website (https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures) for the latest requirements on Safe Management Measures (SMM).
