09 June 2021 marks World Accreditation Day (#WAD2021), a global initiative established by IAF and ILAC to promote the value of accreditation. This yearâ€™s theme is Accreditation: Supporting the Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).



A joint statement by the IAF and ILAC Chairs, a brochure and a poster are now available for download on the IAF website here and the ILAC website here.

 

Editable versions of the poster and brochure for members who wish to add their logos or translate the text will be made available on the members' sides of the IAF and ILAC websites next week.

 

IAF and ILAC will also be releasing three videos with the themes of people, planet and prosperity by 15 May 2021.
