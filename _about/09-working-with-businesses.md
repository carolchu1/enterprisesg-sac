## What is Accreditation?
Accreditation is the endorsement of an organisation’s competence, credibility, independence and integrity against both national and international standards. It effectively evaluates the organisation’s ability in carrying out testing, inspection, calibration and certification services.

SAC is a Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) Signatory to various international organisations including ILAC, IAF, APLAC, PAC. The SAC's mark on test, calibration, inspection reports and certificates will mean that the report is recognised among the MRA partners. Thus, if your services are accredited by SAC, your accredited services will be recognised by the importing countries who are members signatory of the MRA.

For more information about MRA, please click [here](/about/collaborations-and-recognitions/mutual-recognition-arrangement).

## Why Use Accredited CABs?

Using accredited CABs offers multiple benefits for companies. Besides providing a marketing opportunity, it also boosts the company’s image – having been tried and certified by reliable CABs, the company's products and services are endorsed with the highest assurance. This, in turn, instils confidence in the company’s customers and stakeholders alike.

## How Do You Identify a SAC Accredited Conformity Assessment Body?

You can identify a SAC accredited conformity assessment body (CAB) by SAC accreditation marks as proof of accreditation. Accredited reports or certificates carry the SAC mark, along with the unique SAC accreditation certificate number. 

In addition, an accredited test or inspection report will include the following statement:

> *"The results reported herein have been performed in accordance with the terms of accreditation under the Singapore Accreditation Council."*

Accreditation is granted for a specific scope of activities and not for all activities undertaken by the CABs. Thus, accredited CABs are only allowed to issue accredited reports for those tests, calibrations or inspections, or issue accredited certificates for the specific certification scopes which they have been accredited.
