          description: 'Accreditation enhances the credibility of laboratory tests, inspection, certification reports and certificates by providing reliable third party assurance that these services are conducted professionally and meet globally-recognised standards. Conformity Assessment Bodies - such as testing and calibration laboratories, certification bodies as well as inspection bodies - are benchmarked against international standards. This ensures the competency, impartiality and performance capability of their services.'
